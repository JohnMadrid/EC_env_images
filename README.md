# Study Project Embodied Cognition on Wikipedia (I and II)
### Description
Wikipedia is a widely and commonly used online free-content encyclopedia.
However, the quality and reliability of Wikipedia’s articles and content vary
significantly. Since articles are written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers
worldwide, they may contain false, incomplete, and debatable information. This report
documents the joint effort to write, update and improve the quality of the ["embodied
cognition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition) article on Wikipedia–and related ones. Over time, this resulted in an upward trend to reach encyclopedic quality with a "good article" score on the WikiProject
Psychology’s rating scale and an increase in the article's size and pageviews.

### About the repository
This repository contains several folders with information supporting some of the edits done during this project.
- __Assets, Packages, and ProjectSettings__ are the folders required to run the Unity 3D environment. This contains a humanoid that was created to aid the content visualization process but was left unused due to time constrains.
- __WikiPageAnalysis__ contains a jupyter notebook along with all the relevant information (data, images) regarding the data analysis done on the quality, size, and pageviews of the embodied cognition page on Wikipedia.
- __content-diagram__ contains the HTML, JS, and CSS code to create the Venn Diagram portarying the scope of embodied cognition.
- __history-timeline__ contains the HTML, JS, and CSS code to create an alternative version of the image for history timeline of embodied cognition. It was not included in the artcile's final version.
- __Report_Embodied_Cognition__ is a PDF file with the final report of the project summarising the main contributions of the author, the edits done to the article on Wikipedia, and the findings regarding the article's size, quality, and pageviews.
